MASTERPLAN.
===========

By [Brandon Arbini][me] @ [Zencoder][zencoder].

MASTERPLAN is useful for high-level feature tracking.


Background
----------

At Zencoder we use [Pivotal Tracker][pivotal] to manage our development process. Pivotal Tracker is great, really, but stories are very granular (by design) and features get lost. Major features are usually made up of many stories in Pivotal, which makes it hard to keep track of whole features as they move through development, QA, staging, and the various stages of being released. While we used to keep a list of features in a text file in [Dropbox][dropbox] (but no one looked at regularly), we now use MASTERPLAN to keep the whole team on the same page.

Technology
----------

On the back-end, MASTERPLAN is a [Sinatra][sinatra] application using [Redis][redis] as the datastore through the [Toystore][toystore] gem. All of the gem dependencies are managed with [Bundler][bundler] and specified in the Gemfile. On the front-end, MASTERPLAN is an HTML5  application using the [Backbone.js][backbone] MVC framework, [ICanHaz.js][icanhaz] with [Mustache.js][mustache] for templating, [jQuery UI][jqueryui] for sorting magic, [jQuery Mobile][jqmobile] for the mobile interface (accessible at /m).

Setup
-----

MASTERPLAN is [rackable][rackable] and comes with a `config.ru` file to get up and running easily. You can start it by running `rackup`, running under [Passenger][passenger], or by using [Pow][pow]. By default, MASTERPLAN will use a Redis URL of `redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0`, but you can specify a different URL in `app.yml`.

Keyboard Shortcuts
------------------

    , or k      previous feature
    . or j      next feature
    n           new feature
    enter       begin/end editing
    esc         end editing
    x           delete feature

Authentication
--------------

Maybe you don't want your master plan visible to the world? Right now, the easiest way to do that is by using HTTP basic authentication. Just create a password file using `htpasswd` and add an `.htaccess` file in the `public` directory:

    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "My Master Plan"
    AuthUserFile /path/to/password/file
    Require user me

Known Issues/Limitations
------------------------

* There's currently no support for multiple people working in application at the same time. Things get out of sync pretty badly. It's a tough problem that's at the top of the list to be solved.
* Reordering features messes up keyboard navigation. It was working correctly at some point, but some sort of bug crept in.

Feature Wish List
-----------------

* Sorting options (including custom sort, like it is now)
* Filtering (like in the mobile version)
